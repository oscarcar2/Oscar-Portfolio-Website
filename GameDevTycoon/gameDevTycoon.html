        <p>
            I am a hobby Game Designer and qualified Computer Science AP Grad. <br>
            I work on games with fellow graduates at our 3 owner company: Stranded Ocean Games.<br>
            Beyond Game Design, i also program, do game directing and a little bit of art, story and marketing. <br>
            My passion is designing and analyzing mechanics. <br>
            I have ~4 years of experience in amateur game development across several projects viewable on this site. <br>
            Right now I work on the current Stranded Ocean project: FloraHive!
